# README for branch_01 #

This project requires us to develop a website template viewer. See details in [README.md in master branch](https://github.com/bganguly/website-template-viewer-ui/tree/master#readme) 

This specific branch is a very first pass and is essentially just layout work using React components but no state management.  
Uses flex-box model heavily. There is no backend.  
Subsequent branches eg branch_02/branch_03.. etc build on each previous branch.

To run:
```
// git clone and checkout the branch
rm -rf package-lock.json ; rm -rf node-modules/ ; npm i
npm start
```
