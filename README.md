# README for branch_02 #

This project requires us to develop a website template viewer. See details in [README.md in master branch](https://github.com/bganguly/website-template-viewer-ui/tree/master#readme) 

This specific branch builds on top of branch_01 and puts in basic state management to work as a React SPA - using assets/images embedded in source. There is no backend.

To run:
```
// git clone and checkout the branch
rm -rf package-lock.json ; rm -rf node-modules/ ; npm i
npm start
```
