# README for branch_01 #

This project requires us to develop a website template viewer. See details in [README.md in master branch](https://github.com/bganguly/coding-project-ui/tree/master#readme) 

This specific branch is essentially just layout work using React components but no state management. Uses flex-box model heavily. There is no backend.

To run:
```
// git clone and checkout the branch
rm -rf package-lock.json ; rm -rf node-modules/ ; npm i
npm start
```
